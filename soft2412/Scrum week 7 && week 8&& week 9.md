## Agile Methods
- #### Extreme Programming(XP)
	- page 12
	- development and delivery of very small increments of functionality
	- rely on constant code improvement.
	- use Test Driven Development(TDD) as part of small development iterations.
- #### $Scrum$
	- manage SD to deliver product with highest value.
	- Continuous improment of product, the team and the working environment,
	- lightweight, simple to understand but hard to master.

## Scrum
#### Pillars of empirical process control.
![[Pasted image 20201126164727.png]]

#### Scrum value
- commitment: personal commit to achieving the goals of the team
- courage: member can do the right thing and work on tough problem
- Focus: everyone focus on the work of the iteration and the team's goal
- openness: the team and the stakeholders agree to be open about the work and the challenges with performing the work.
- Respect: team members respect each other to be capable, independent. 

#### Scrum practice
- Teams and their roles
	- Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team
- Events
	- Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Retrospective
- Artifacts
	- Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
- Project estimation and Sprint estimation
	- Rules govern the relationships between roles, events and artifacts


## Scrum Team
- small to be agile
- cross functional
- self-organizing
- deliver product iterative and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback.

## Team role
- Development Team
- Product Owner
	- Maximize value of the product and the work
		- understand the requriement and priority
		- manage the product backlog 
- Scrum Master
	- Record product backlog items and order it.
	- Optimizr the value of the work the development team perform.
	- ensure transparency and clarity of the profuct backlog
	- ensure the development team understand product backlog.



## Sprint
a development iteration(one cycle)
page 33


#### Consist of
- the sprint planning, 
- daily scrum, 
- the development work, 
- the sprint review,
- the sprint retrospective.

### Sprint planning
- Identify the Sprint Goal (items from the “Product Backlog”)
- Identify work to be done to deliver this
- Two-parts meeting (Scrum Master (SM), Product Owner (PO) and Dev team)
	- Before meeting: PO prepares prioritized list of most valuable items
	- Part 1 (max. 4 hours): PO & Dev team select items to be delivered at the end of the Sprint based value and team’s estimate of how much work needed
	- Part 2 (max. 4 hours): Dev team (with the PO’s help) identify the individual tasks they’ll use to implement those items
- Output: Sprint Backlog (the items selected by the team for development)


### Scrum iteration process
- Sprint(development iteration)
	- time box
	- create a "Done" usable, potentailly releasable product.


### Daily Scrum meeting
交流看见的困难，客户有可能参加
我昨天做了什么， 我今天要做什么， 我遇到了什么问题
但不解决问题，follow-up meeting 讨论这些

### sprint review
- End of sprint meeting
客户的feedback，交流意见
更新product backlog，对下个sprint更改

### Retrospectives
上个sprint做的怎么样，下个周期怎么进步


## Product backlog
- set all features and sub features to build the product.
- maintain by the PO with customer and team.
- the source of the product requirement
- the items ordered by priority- value to the customer.

## Sprint backlog
-  set of items selected for the sprint, a plan for delivering the product increment and realize the Sprint Goal.
-  Identified by Dev. team
-  include at least one high prioruty improvement from previous Sprint




## Progress Monitor
Total work remianing to rach the goal
- compaare with the previous sprint
- forecast progress through the burn down and burn up or cumulative flow.

# WEEK 8
## Plan and Document
page 7
- functional
- non-functional

### Requirement documentation


## Behaviour Driven Development(BDD)
page 23
Use userstory elivit functional requirement.
#### User Story
good user story
- specific
- measureable
- achievable
- relevant
- timeboxed

 
 
 
 ## format of a user story
  -----------------------------
  feature: 				
  As a []					  
  I want to ...		   
  so that ...			    
  condition of satisfy:
  1. 
  2. 
  -----------------------------
 
## Scenarios format
page54

scenario: brief description of the scenario
Given: precondition
When: action
Then: outcome

# Week 9
## Story point(SP)
No. of story points is about overall size of story.
based on the difficulty but not time spend.

### Staring story points
two approaches:
Smallest story : 1 sp
Medium-size story: in the middle of range you use

- ideal days : 理想
- elapsed days : 保守
