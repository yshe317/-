## UML principle

## UML diagram

### Structureal View
- static structure of the system(Object,attribute,operation and relationship)
- such as: class diagram
### Behavioural view
- Dynamic behaviour of the system(Collaboration among object and changes to the internal states of objects)
- Interaction(subset of the dynamic view)- emphasizes flow of the control and data
- for example: sequence diagram

## Rational Unified Process



## OO design and Implementation model
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Reuse
- Maintenance
