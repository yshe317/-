# Phasor
A [phasor](https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/BackGround/phasor/phasor.html) is a complex number that represents a signal that is sinusoidal in time. We could first take a sinusoidal signal in time defined by magnitude, phase and frequency.

$$z = x + jy$$

where $j = \sqrt{-1}$, x is the real part of z and y is the imaginary part of z.  the complex number z could also be written in polar or exponential form.

$$z = r\angle \phi = re^{j\phi}$$

The below picture shows the relationship between the rectangle form and the polar form. 

$$r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}, \phi = tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}$$

## Euler's identity

The idea of phasor representatio is based on Euler's identity, in general,

>$$e^{\pm j\phi} = cos\phi \pm jsin\phi$$

since v(t) takes the cosine part of the expression, it is the real part of ![[Pasted image 20201121164206.png]]

V is thus the **phasor representation** of the sinusoid v(t).
