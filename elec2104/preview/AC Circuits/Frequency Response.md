# Transfer Function
a transfer functioon $H(\omega)$ is a tool for finding the frequency response of a circuit. The frequency response of a circuit is just the circuit's transfer function $H(\omega)$ versus $\omega$, with $\omega$ vary from  $\omega = 0$ to  $\omega = \infty$.

> The transfer function of a circuit is the frequency-dependent ratio of a phasor output $Y(\omega)$(element voltage or current) to a phasor input $X(\omega)$(source voltage or current)

$$H(\omega) = \frac{Y(\omega)}{X(\omega)}$$

$H(\omega)$ has a magnitude $H(\omega)$ and a phase $\phi$, that is $H(\omega) = \frac{H(\omega)}{\phi}$
