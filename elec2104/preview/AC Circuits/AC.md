# Intro

A Sinusoid is a singal that has the form of the sine or cosine function/ A sinusoidal current is usually referred to as alternating current (AC). Such a current reverses at regular time intervals and has alternately positive and negative sources. 

## Sinusoids

It is evident that the sinusoid repeats itself every T seconds, so we could call T a period of the sinusoid. Therefore we could obtain:

> $$T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$
> $$v(t+T) = v(t)$$

The period T of the periodic function is the time of one complete cycle or the number of seconds per cycle, while the reciprocal of this quantity is the number of cycles per second, known as the cyclic frequency f of the sinusoid

>$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

and hence we could obtain that
>$$ \omega = 2 \pi f$$



## Phase
we now introduce a more general expression for the sinusoid by having:
$$v(t) = V_msin(\omega t + \phi)$$

Here $\phi$ is the phase for the sinusoid. We say that two sinusoids are out of phase if they have different phi, and otherwise they are in phase.
