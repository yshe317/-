# Circuit Elements
## Branches
In electrical circuits, branches are circuit elements that have 2 terminals. For example, a voltage source.


## Nodes

A node is a point of connection between two or more branches. If a short circuit connects two nodes, then these two nodes could be "merged" into one node.

In the first figure, there are many nodes, which could be merged into several single nodes. The reason for this layout is to make the whole circuit look tidy. 

## Loop
a loop is a closed circuit that is formed by starting from one node, and then passing through a set of other nodes and then return to the starting node without visiting any nodes more than once.
