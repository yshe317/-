# About capacitors and inductors
Capacitors and inductors are passive circuit elements that could store energy, which is the opposite of resistors (which costs energy).
# capacitors

## basics
a capacitor is composed of two conducting plates separated by an insulator(or dielectric)
![[Pasted image 43.png]]

when voltage is applied to capacitors, the source deposits a positive charge q on one plate and a negative charge -q on another plate. The amount of charge stored is directly proportional to the amount of voltage applied. Therefore

==q = Cv== where q is the amount of charge, v is the voltage applied and c is the constant of proprotionality. 

the unit of capacitance is in farad(F), which is the ratio of the charge on one plate to the ratio of the voltage difference between two plates

These two equations represent the energy stored in the electric field that exists between the plates of the capacitor.

### properties of capacitors
1. a capacitor is an open circuit to dc
2. The voltage on a capacitor cannot change abruptly
3. the ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy

## Series and Parallel Capacitors
Capaciators could also be connected in series or parallel as in resistive circuits, and we could obtain a single equivalent capacitance similar to the way we obtain equivalent resistence. 

### Equivalent capacitance
#### parallel
The equivalent capacitance of parallel-connected capacitors is equal to the sum of the individual capacitance.

#### series
The equivalent capacitance of series-connected capacitors is equal to the reciprocol of the sum of the reciprocol of capacitance of individual capacitors

# Inductors
An inductor is passive element designed to store energy in its magnetic field. Inductors could be used in electronic and power systems or used in radios, Tvs, radars and electric motors.

### inductance
inductance is the property that measures how much an inductors opposes to the change of current flowing through it, measured in henrys(H)

for a linear inductor, its inductance is independent of the current, and its voltage current charactersistcs follows the equation in [[Capacitors and Inductors#voltage current relationship]].

As for a non-linear inductor, its inductance varies with the current.

### energy stored in an inductor

## properties
1. An inductor acts like a short circuit to dc
2. the current through an inductor cannot change instaneously
3. an ideal inductor does not dessipite energy
4. in practical, an inductor has resistence as it is made of conducting material such as copper, this resistence is called winding resistence Rw. A non idea inductor also has capacitance Cw, however, both Rw and Cw are small and could be ignored in most cases.

## Series and Parallel Inductors
### Series connected inductors
The equivalent inductance of series connected inductors is the sum of the inductance of individual inductors

### Parallel connected inductors
The equivalent inductance of parallel inductors is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual inductance.
