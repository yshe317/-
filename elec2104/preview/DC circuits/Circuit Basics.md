# Parallel Resistors and current division
if two resistors are connected in parallel, then they have the same voltage across them.

Here, v = i1R1 = i2R2

## equivalent resistence of two parallel resistors
the equivalent resistence of two parallel resistors equal to their product divided by their sum.
