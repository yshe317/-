# Introduction
now we've covered three passive elements (resistors, inductors and capacitors), and one active element (op amp), now we could consider circuits that contain various combinations of two or three of the passive elements.

an RC circuit contains both a resistor and a capacitor, while an RL circuit contains resistors and an inductor

We could still apply Kirchoff's law to solve RC and Rl circuits just like we did for resistive circuits, however, we could only obtain first-order differential equations as a result, and hence these two circuits are called first-order circuits. 


>a first-order circuit is characterized by a first-order differential equation

## Source free RC circuit
in a source free rc circuit, the capacitor is initially chargerd, and as time passes, the voltage level gradually drops

which imples that at t = $\tau$, 
$$\tau = RC$$

in terms of the time constant
$$v(t) = V_0e^{-t\tau}$$
