# Ohm's law
The ohm's law states that the voltage v across a resistor is directly proportional to the current i flowing through the resistor

R = p * L / a
where p is the resistivity of the material, l is the length and a is the cross-section area of the material.

the circuit element used to represent the current-resisting behavior is the **resistor**

### FORMS OF OHM'S LAW
==V = IR==

# Kirchoff's law
There are two Kirchoff's laws that could be combined with Ohm's law to conduct analysis of circuits.

## Kirchoff's first law (KCL)
the kirchoff's first law states that the sum of currents entering a node is zero.

an alternative understanding of KCL is that the sum of the currents entering a node is equal tothe sum of currents leaving the node.

## Kirchoff's Voltage law(KVL)
KVL states that the algebraic sum of all the voltages around a closed path is zero.

This implies that the sum of voltage drops should be equivalent to the sum of the voltage rises around a node.
