# 8.2 MOSFET
MOSFET stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor Field Effect Transistor.(the field effect part suggests that it works by votlage, compared to BJT which works by current) It is a four terminal device that have a Gate(G), a Source(S) and a Drain(D) and a substrate or Body(n or p type semiconductor). Depending on the type of semiconductor, there are NMOS and PMOS transistors. 

Gate is a top conductive plate with low resistivity material residing on a thin dielectric(oxide insulator) layer. The source provides carriers whie drain absorbs carriers.

## 8.2.1 MOS Capacitor Operation
[MOSFET OPERATION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfvyj88Hs_o)
 Just consider three layers: a conductive plate(Metal), an insulator(oxide insulator) and a doped pice of silicon(semiconductor). These three layers form a MOS. 
 ![[Pasted image 20201024170657.png]]

When applying voltage on the top plate,  the positive voltage at the top layer attracts negative charges at the bottom layer, making the negative charges attacted to the top and repeling the positive holes away from the insulator. Hence electrons flow towards top, concentrating below the insulator, creating a channel or path of free electrons. 
The charge is proportional to both the capacitance and the voltage applied. (similar to a capacitor)

>$$Q = CV_1$$

In the third diagram, if we apply another voltage $V_2$ across the silicon, electrons then drift from left to right, and the current flows through the channel. This is because the conductive channel has the least resistance, and the current always chooses to go through the path with the least resistance. 



## 8.2.2 MOSFET structure
The MOS capacitor forms the central part of the MOSFET. This is an n-type MOSFET, and the middle part, as mentioned previously, is to provide a channel of electrons.
![[Pasted image 20201024173536.png]]

MOSFET is quite different from BJT, BJT is asymmetric, but the MOSFET is the symmetric, so it does not matter the direction of voltage we apply to it(we could invert the voltage and still get the same behavior). This also implies that both the source and drain are equally doped. 


## 8.2.3 NMOS Operation
first we ground the source and drain, and varies the gate voltage. There is some threshold voltage $V_{TN}$. When the gate source voltage $V_{GS} << V_{TN}$, there is no significant current except small leakage current due to the negatively doped semiconductors. 

![[Pasted image 20201024174022.png]]

When $V_{GS} < V_{TN}$, as $V_G$ rises, positive charge on the gate repels the holes in the subtrate, creating a depletion region which is devoid of free carriers(a depletion region with only fixed, negatively charged ions). There is no channel of mobile charges formed yet, so there is no current. 
![[Pasted image 20201024231044.png]]

If we continue to increase $V_{GS}$ to a point where $V_{GS} > V_{TN}$, then $V_G$ becomes sufficiently positive, and free electrons start to get attracted to the gate. An ==inversion layer== is formed, which is a conductive channel connecting S to D. As the layer grows and electrons gradually flow from the source to the drain, eventually, the layer fully connects the drain and the source, forming a conductive channel between them. The voltage when this layer forms is the "threshold voltage" $V_{TN}$.(TN is denoted for n-type MOSFET)

![[Pasted image 20201024224233.png]]

The conductive channel could be considered as a voltage dependent resistor.  Notice that when two terminals are at the same potential, then there is no current flows between S and D. Therefore the above MOSFET has not current as both terminals are grounded. 

If we apply positive voltage between D and S. 
For MOSFET, the main current transport mechanism is the ==drift current==.

## 8.2.4 Operation

![[Pasted image 20201024224902.png]]

If we have a constant drain voltage, when the voltage at the gate is smaller than the threshold voltage, there is no current as the inversion layer has not fully formed. This is indicated by the flat curve in the beginning. Then the MOSFET is turned on and the current increases and $V_G$ increases. 

In the second diagram, if $V_G$ is constant and MOSFET is turned on, then there is a linear relationship between $I_D$ and $V_{D}$

## 8.2.5 Channel Pinch-off
Along the channel from the source to the drain, the voltage increases. That is, the closer to the drain, the greater the voltage. At x = L, the density of electrons falls to minimum, and we could reach a pinch-off point where there is very minimum amount of electrons present. 
![[Pasted image 20201024232609.png]]

At pinch-off point, the gate-substrate potential difference is not sufficient enough to attract electrons, and if $V_D$ is high enough, $V_G - V_D \leq V_{TN}$. The channel hence ends near the drain, and the channel pinches-off. 
![[Pasted image 20201024232944.png]] 

If $V_D$ rises further, $V_D > V_G - V_{TN}$ at x = L. That is, the channel ends even before it reaches the drain, and the electron path between the source and the drain is disconnected. However, ==the electron can still flow even though there is no channel. ==

Recall the knowledge about the PN junction, the electrons at the end of the channel could be considered as being injected into the depletion region of a PN junction. We need to bias the junction so that the electrons could be swept to the n side(which is done by $V_D$).  The main purpose of $V_D$ is to make the drain more positive than the source, allowing electrosn to be swept or attracted to it (when MOSFET is on), independent of the value of $V_D$, now it only attracts the electrons, rather than controlling the current. This is why MOSFET acts as a ==constant current source== independent of $V_{DS}$

![[Pasted image 20201024233810.png]]

The pinch-off voltage is:
> $$V_P = V_{GS} - V_{TN}$$

## 8.2.4 Mathmatical Analysis
First we have $Q = CV$, and the capacitance of the MOSFET is dependent on the thickness and the width of the insulating area. 

Hence $Q = WC_{ox}(V_{GS} - V_{TN})$ where W is the width of the metal-oxide layer, and $C_{ox}$ is just some constant for the capacitance of the metal-oxide layer and it is something we cannot control, so we just separate it as a constant. That is $C = WC_{ox}$. 

Since the channel voltage varies along x, we could have $Q = WC_{ox}(V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TN})$, where $V(x)$ is the voltage along the x-axis. Recall from [[02.2 Drift Currents and Diffusion Currents#Drift Current| drift current]], we have $J_{drift} = Q\mu_nE = q\mu\frac{dV}{dx}$ If we rearrange the equation and take integrals for both sides, we could obtain:

$$\int_{L}^{0} {I_D}dx = \int_{V_D}{V_S}WC_{ox}\mu_n(V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TN})dV$$

The left hand side takes the integral from 0 to L, which measure the current densities across the channel, this is just the current flowing through the channel. 

>$$I_D = \beta(V_{GS} - V_{TN} - \frac{V_{DS}}{2})V_{DS}$$ where $\beta = \mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}$


## 8.2.5 Regions of Operation

### 8.2.5.1 Linear or Triode Region
For small drain voltages where $\frac{V_{DS}}{2} << (V_{GS} - V_{TN})$, we could neglect the former term, resulting in

$$I_D \approx \mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TN})V_{DS}$$which acts as a resistor between drain and source.

The resistor value (on resistance) can be controlled by the gate-source voltage:
$$R_{on} = \frac{V_{DS}}{I_D} = \frac{1}{\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{TN})}$$

The i-v curve can be approximated near the origin by straight lines with different slopes.

### 8.2.5.2 Saturation Region
The drain current saturates at a constant value for $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TN}$. When analysing for the saturation region, we only consider from 0 to $L_1$, which is the end of the channel.
![[Pasted image 20201025004025.png]]

The important formula for $I_D$ that is independent of $V_{DS}$
> $$I_D = \frac{1}{2}\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L_1}(V_{GS}-V_{TN})^2$$

The MOSFET acts as a constant current source at the saturation region. This means $I_D$ does not change with $V_D$, that's why the curve flattens in the saturation region. When $V_{DS}$ is very low, we could approximate a linear relationship, but as it grows larger, it enters the saturation region after the pinch-off voltage, and increasing $V_{DS}$ has not effect on the current anymore.
