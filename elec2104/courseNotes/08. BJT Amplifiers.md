# 8.1 Biasing
## 8.1.1 Configurations
![[Pasted image 20201020184723.png]]
These are the three most common configurations, and notice that $V_in, V_out$ are not equal to $V_B$ or $V_C$(that are DC signals that determine the operation points), instead, they are small signals. We are only discussing about the small signals.

More explicitely, consider we are inputting a small sine wave into the BJT, and this wave is amplified with much greater amplitude and period. This is what we are focusing on. 

## 8.1.2 gain of amplifier
![[Pasted image 20201020185132.png]]
The right hand side is a small signal model that models how current changes according to input voltage change, which relates $V_{out}$ to $V_{in}$
Recall [[06 Bipolar Junction Transistors#6 5 Small Signal Model| small signal equations]]. We have $A_V = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}$ and $-\frac{V_{out}}{R_C} = g_mv_\pi = g_mv_{in}$
> $$A_V = -g_mR_C$$

The negative sign means the input voltage is inverted (and amplified) when outputted. (out of phase by 180)

## 8.1.3 Input/Output Impedance
This determiens the capability to interre with preceding and following stages. Input impedance is ideally infinite as it could then act similar to an open circuit, feeding all the voltages to the BJT(since we don't want any voltage loss). Oppostiely, we would want the output impedance to close to 0 so that all the voltages could be passed to the following stage.  Notice that when measuring output inpedance, the input port has to be grounded so that $v_{in}$ is grounded(this means there are no currents flowing to the left of $R_2$, there is only a current flowing from $V_{x}$ to $R_2$)

## 8.1.4 Common-Emitter with Early Effect
$$A_V = -g_m(R_C||r_o$$
the early voltage is influenced by the overall resistance
$$R_{out} = R_c || r_o$$
The output impedance is also influenced by $r_o$
we could not neglect the early effect(when the early voltage is almost infinity), we should consider the early effect  ![[Pasted image 20201024114122.png]]

If we include $r_o$, the resistor is parallel 


# 8.2 Common-base Amplifier
In the common-base configuration, the base terminal is biased with a fixed voltage, and the emitter terminal is fed with a signal, and the collector is the output. 
![[Pasted image 20201024114732.png]]

To analyze a common-base amplifier,we could first convert it to a small signal model, 
![[Pasted image 20201024114900.png]]

since $V_b$ is considered as a constant, when converting it to the small signal model, we ground it. That's why the B-terminal is grounded. Similarly $V_{cc}$ does not appear in the small signal model as well.

Recall that we could calculate the voltage gain with
$$A_V = \frac{V_{out}}{v_{in}}$$

and the output voltage $V_{out}$ is
$$v_{out} = -g_mv_\pi R_c$$

also, the input voltage is equal to $-v_\pi$, therfore, we could obtain another way to represent $A_v$: 

$$A_v = \frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} = \frac{v_{out}}{-v_\pi} = g_mR_c$$

that is,
>$$A_V = g_mR_c$$

The voltage gain of CB stasge is hence $g_mR_C$, which is identical to that of CE(common-emitter) stage in magnitude and opposite in phase. This means the input and output voltage are in phase, the output voltage just have greater magnitude as it is the amplified version of the input voltage.

## 8.2.1 Impedance of CB
![[Pasted image 20201024120101.png]]

The input impedance is $\frac{v_x}{i_x}$ and $i_x = -(g_mV_\pi + \frac{v\pi}{R_c})$. After simplification, we could obtain that 

>$$R_{in} = \frac{v_x}{i_x} = \frac{1}{g_m}$$ 

The very low input impedance can create a match with 50 $\Omega$ transmission lines.(since we want the input impedance to be as high as possible, if it is low, we need to add additional resistance)

## 8.2.2 EXAMPLE
![[Pasted image 20201024121944.png]]

This is a common-emitter amplifier, and we need to first calculate the three small signal parameters, and then consider the early effect as there is an early voltage $V_A =10V$.
