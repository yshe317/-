# PN JUNCTION
If we join a p-type semiconductor with an n-type semiconductor, we could obtain a PN-junction. This is a semiconductor diode

The p-side is anode, and n-side becomes cathode. A PN junction semiconductor is also called a diode.

## Fermi Level
The energy level where the probability of finding an electron is one-half(for intrinsic conductors)

![[Pasted image 197.png]]

Extrinsic semiconductor has the Fermi level changed dur to doping(either donor or acceptor)

## Application
PN junctions are the fundamental building blocks of almost all semiconductor devices such as voltage protectors, lasers, and radiation detectors.

It is hence critical to understand how PN junctions work in order to understand transistors.

---
## Equilibrium
A pn junction is at equilibrium when the terminals are open and there is no applied voltage

At equilibrium, p side contains large excess of holes and n side contains large excess of electrons,  
![[Pasted image 192.png]]

At the boundary, There is a sharp gradient of concentration, and hence a large diffusion current. Electrons flow to p side, and holes flwo to n side.
 
![[Pasted image 195.png]]

Note that device cannot carry a net current indefinitely, which means diffusion must eventually decay to zero. 

There must be something that stops the flow, otherwise the current will flow out of the diode.


---
## Recombination
Since mobile chargers tend to flow from high concentration to low concentration areas, electrons from n flows to p, and holes from p flows to n.


### Depletion Region
The tendency mentioned above causes some electrons from n to combine with holes in p, and holes from p combine with electrons in n. Since the mobile chargers diffuse away from their original region, localised acceptor or donor ions are left behind(since they cannot diffuse away). 
![[Pasted image 193.png]]

These localised ions form a region of fixed ion, which is known as **depletion region, or space-charge region**(since all mobile chargers are depleted).

![[Pasted image 194.png]]

The space between $-X_p$ an d $X_n$ is the Space Charge Region(SCR), and the regions beyond SCR are neutral region.

Notice that the depletion is not neutrally charged, it has positively charged ions on the n side, and negatively charged ions on the p side. Therefore, the depletion region has built-in voltage due to the two regions of oppositely charged ions. This electric field causes drift current to occur across the region. 

Moreover, the field forces positive charge to flow from right to left, while the concentration gradient causes holes to flow from right to left(which means they are oppositve in direction). Hence a diode is at equilibrium if the electric field is strong enough to completely stop the diffusion current.

## Currents at equilibrium
According to the above observations, we could find:
$$|I_{drift,p} + I_{drift,n}| = |I_{diff,p}| + |I_{diff,n}|$$
This is because the drift currents caused by the electric field in the space charge region has opposite directions to their corresponding diffusion currents, which make them cancel each other out, resulting in zero net current at equilibrium.

The above condition also raises an unrealistic phenomenon: if the number of electrons flowing from p side to the n side is equal to that of the holes from the opposite direction, then each side of this equation is zero, and hence:
$$|I_{drift,p}| = |I_{diff,p}|$$
$$|I_{drift,n}| = |I_{diff,n}|$$

## Build-in potential
$V_i$ is the built-in potential in a diode.
>$$V_{bi} = \frac{kT}{q}ln\frac{N_AN_D}{{n^i}^2}$$

The derivation process of the above equation is:
![[Pasted image 202.png]]
$E_M$ is the maximum electric field strength.


---
## Electric Field

The electric field in the depletion zone is proprotional to the integral of the space charge density and is zero at charge neutral regions.

>$$E_(x) = \frac{1}{\epsilon_s}\int p_c(x)dt$$

where $\epsilon_s$ is assumed to be the constant permitivity of a semiconductor(in$F/cm$)

---
## Depletion Width
>$$\sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon_s}{q}(\frac{1}{N_A}+\frac{1}{N_D})V_{bi}}$$

## PN junction under reverse bias
We say that the junction is under "reverse bias[^1]" if we apply an external voltage across the device that makes the n side more positive than p side.

[^1]: the word "bias" means operation under some "desirable conditions"

![[Pasted image 205.png]]

Since under equilibrium, E is directed from the n side to the p side, $V_R$ enhances the field. However, a higher electric field can only be sustained if a larger amount of fiexed charge is provided, which widens the depletion region.

#### influence
Since the voltage strengthens the field, the barrier rises even higher, making the current negligible under reverse bias.

From fig 2.23, we could see that there are more positive ions building on the n side, and more negative ions building on the p side, which means the device is operating as a [[Capacitors and Inductors#capacitors|capaciator]]. (the assumption is that the charge in the depletion region resides on each plate equivalently)

#### why reverse-biased diode?
Since any two plates could for a capaciator, the use of reverse bias on PN junction may not seem justified. However, reverse-biased PN junctions has a unique property that makes it useful in circuit design. As $V_R$ increases, the width of the depletion region also increases, which means the "two plates" are moving away from each other as voltage increases. This results in a special characteristics: the voltage-dependent capacitance.

#### calculate the capacitance
the per unit area capacitance of the junction is: 
$$C_j = \frac{C_{j0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{V_R}{V_0}}}$$

$C_{j0}$ is the capacitance corresponding to the 0 bias, and $V_0$ is the built-in potential. The value of $C_{j0}$ is hence:

$$C_{j0} = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{si}q}{2}\frac{N_AN_D}{N_A + N_D}\frac{1}{V_0}}$$

where $\epsilon_{si}$ is the dielectric constant of silicon that is equal to $11.7 \times 8.85 \times 10^{-14} F/cm^{10}$

## PN junction under forward bias
If we apply an external voltage source $V_f$ which makes the the p side more positive than n side, $V_f$ creates a positive electric field from p to n. This electric field caused by $V_f$ is opposite to the direction of the built-in electric field, and the potential barrier reduces due to weakening of the field. 

The process of connecting an external voltage source to apply positive voltage to the p terminal is called **forward bias**
![[Pasted image 196.png]]

 ### Influence
Since the potential barrier is lowered due to the forward bias, it is now easier for electrons to move to p and holes to move to n.

This generates a forward diode current which is the increase in diffusion current.

### Minority Carriers
The minority carriers on the n-side under forward bias:
![[Pasted image 206.png]]
the subscript e emphasises equilibrium conditions(that is $p_{p,e}$ is the hole concentration at p side at equilibrium), $V_t = kT/q$ is called the thermal voltage.

In forward bias, the potential barrier is lowered by an amount equal to applied voltage:

$$p_{n,f} = \frac{p_{p,f}}{exp\frac{V_0-V_F}{V_T}}$$
here the subscript f denotes forward bias, since the exponential denominator drops quickly, we could say t hat $p_{n,f}$ is must higher than $p_{n,e}$. In other words, the minority(since n is minority at p side) carrier concentration on the p side **rises rapidly** with the forward bias voltage, while the majority concentration **remains relatively constant.**

#### summary
as the below image shows, as the junction goes from equilibrium to forward bias,$n_p$ and $p_n$(minorities) increase dramatically, leading to a proportional change in the diffusion currents.

## Reverse Saturation Current
![[Pasted image 207.png]]

it can be proved that 
>$$I_{tot} = I_S(exp\frac{V_F}{V_T}-1)$$

Reverse Saturation Current:
>$$I_S = Aqn^2_i(\frac{D_n}{N_AL_n}+\frac{D_p}{N_DL_p})$$

where $L_{n,p}$ is the electron and hole diffusion lengths, and A is the cross section area of the device.

$\frac{D_n}{N_AL_n}$ is the flow of electrons and $\frac{D_p}{N_DL_p}$ is the flow of holes.

![[Pasted image 211.png]]

The reverse saturation current depends on the thermal generation of holes and electrons near the junction, it does not depend on the potential barrier and it is quite small but increases with temperature.

## I/V characteristics in Forward Bias

#### Why minority concentration must vary
Along the x-axis, the minority concentration must vary as otherwise they have no tendency to flow over the depletion area and there will be zero net current. They must vary so that diffusion could occur.

#### Recombination of minorities
As the minority carrier goes deep into another area, their concentration falls(as mentioned in the above section), however, the current remains constant along the x-axis. This is because of the recombinations. For examples, electrons enter the p side and they gradually recombine with the holes(which are abundant at p side). 

Therefore, near the depletion region, the current consists of mostly minority carriers, but towards the far contacts, it is primarily comprised of majority carriers,

at any point along the x-axis, the two components add up to $l_{tot}$, maintaining the constant current.

## Diode I-V characteristics
The current flowing through the diode is related to the reverse saturation current $I_S$,( which is the current when the voltage applied is negative)

![[Pasted image 264.png]]
 
 Below is the i-v characteristics for 3 different states of a pn junction.

 ## Summary
 The junction equation is given by
 $$I_D = I_S(exp\frac{V_D}{V_T}-1)$$
 
 $$I_S = Aqn^2(\frac{D_n}{N_AL_n} + \frac{D_p}{N_DL_P})$$
 
 where $I_D$ is the diode current and $V_D$ is the diode voltage.
 
 The **reverse saturation current** is the current when voltage is under reverse biased 
 
 ![[Pasted image 266.png]]
 
 
 We can plot the flow of current in response to the applied voltage, which is called the I-V curve, note that the applied voltage must exceed the built-in potential before significant diffusion current can flow, and this voltage is called "**turn-on voltage**"
 
 ![[Pasted image 267.png]]

 ## Constant-voltage mode
 as the reverse voltage increases, the electric field within the device grows and eventually the diode enters a **breakdown region**. which is characterised by a sudden increase in current, which is proportional to further increase in voltage.
 
 The magnitude of voltage at which breakdown occurs is called the breakdown voltage $V_{BD}$. The value of $V_{BD}$ is mainly determined by the doping level on the more lightly doped side of the pn junction.
 
 ![[Pasted image 268.png]]
 
 #### Avalanche Breakdown
 Silicon diodes with voltage greater than 5.6v enter breakdown through a mechanism called **avalance breakdown**
 
 as the width of the depletion layer increases due to reverse bias, the electric fields increases, and any free carriers entering the depletion zone will be accelerated tremendously, causing them to collide with fixed atoms, breaking the covalent bonds and free additional atoms. This creates additional electron-hole pairs and this process continues, creating increasing currents due to extra free carriers moving around. 
 
 #### Zener Breakdown
 Zener Breakdown occurs only in heavily doped diodes, which results in a very narrow depletion-region width, and application of a reverse bias causes carriers to tunnel directly between the conduction and valence bandes, resulting in a rapidly increasing reverse current in the diode
 
 #### Light and diodes
 if the depletion region of a pn junction is illuminated with light with sufficiently high frequency, then photons can provide enough energy to cause eletrons to jump to the semiconductor gap and generate electron-hole pairs.
 
 When electron-hole pairs are generated in the depletion region, it creates a reverse current 
 ![[Pasted image 269.png]]
 
 Photodiodes are operated in reverse bias because the hole-electron pairs are generated in the depletion region. A dc current is generated through the diode in photodiode applications, and they are used for remote control receivers, CD players, solar cells and so on.

 ## Light-Emitting Diodes
 
 LED uses recombination processes in the forward-biased pn junction diode to produce light. When a hole and electron recombine, an energy equal to the bandgap of the semiconductor is released as a photon, which causes the LED to emit light.
