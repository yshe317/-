# Common-Source Amplifier
similar to BJT, input and output signals can be applied and received at any of the 3 terminals of a MOSFET. The common-source amplifier has the source terminal grounded and could serve as transconductance or voltage amplifier.

## I/O impedances
![[Pasted image 20201105174940.png]]

note that the output impedance is obtained by first connecting the input terminal to the ground, and then provide a test current to calculate the impedance. 

$$R_{out} = R_D = \frac{V_x}{I_x}$$

## CS amplifier in saturation
![[Pasted image 20201105180042.png]]

To maintain the operation in saturation region, the input voltage could not fall below the output voltage by more than 1 threshold voltage. 


## Source follower
![[Pasted image 20201105180518.png]]
The source follower configuration has the output voltage at the source side, and the change in $V_{in}$ also changes the gate source voltage, which then influences the drain current, which then influences $g_m$. That is, $V_{out}$ follows $V_{in}$

## Comparison between BJT and MOSFET
![[Pasted image 20201105222640.png]]

bipolar devices have higher $g_m$ than MOSFET due to its exponential characteristics.

# OP-AMPs
[[Operational Amplifiers]] are useful for algorithmic operations on signals. We could consider it as a black box with two inputs and one output. It amplifies the difference between the two inputs and produce an amplified voltage at the output. 
$$v_{out} = A(v_+ - v_-)$$

It is an **active** device as it needs dual power-supply in order to amplify the input signals and the sign of the output is determined by the sign of ($v_+ - v_-$).  

![[Pasted image 20201105223143.png]]

As $A \rightarrow \infty$, the difference between $v_+ - v_-$ becomes infinitely small.

## Ideal op-amp model
The ideal op-amp model has the following 3 assumptions:
- output impedance is zero
- infinite open-loop gain A, which means $v_+ = v_-$
- infinite input impedance: i_+ = i_- = 0

Note that we could only apply [[Ohm's law and Kirchoff's law#Kirchoff's first law KCL|KCL]] at the input terminals and we could not apply it at the output as the output current is unknown.

## Non-inverting Op-Amp circuit
For a non-inverting amplifier, the feedback is connected to the inverting terminal($V_-$). The ideal analysis for the inverting op-amp is:

### I/O impedance

## Inverting Op-Amp Circuit
The non-inverting input is grounded for an inverting op-amp circuit.  The feedback is still connected to the inverting terminal, but the input is also fed at this terminal, making the output and inverted, amplified gain.

### I/O impedance

## Integrator
Considering an op-amp with general impedances around the inverting op-amp, we could have 

![[Pasted image 20201105234149.png]]

we could employ more complex impedances:

$$\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = -\frac{Z_b}{Z_a}$$

an integrator is a circuit where $Z_B$ is replaced by a capacitor. The circuit now uses the frequency-dependent feedback and its gain depends on R,C and s now.

[Wiki Integrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit) the term $\frac{1}{RC}$ is the complex impedance of a capacitor

## Differentiator
Input resistor $Z_A$ is replaced by a capacitor, and the output is just a scaled version of the derivative of the input voltage, resulting in :

# Phasor

To prepare for frequency domain analysis, we could consider AC signals sinusoids and take the cosine wave for analysis.
![[Pasted image 20201105234617.png]]

Generally every frequency curve has the following characteristics

>$$V_1(t) = V_1cos(wt + \theta_1)$$

where $V_1$ is the amplitude, $w$ is the frequency and $\theta_1$ is the phase. 

## Phasor Domain

## Circuit elements in phasor domain
![[Pasted image 20201105234802.png]]

We could simply remember them as:
- for resistor, it's R
- for inductor, its SL
- for capacitor, it's $\frac{1}{SC}$

## Frequency Response
Frequency reponse is a circuit's change in behavior due to variations in signal frequency. This is just the magnitudes and phases of the circuit at all frequencies. 

![[Pasted image 20201105235025.png]]

## Transfer Function
When analysing a circuit, we could simply think it as a blackbox which takes some input and produce output.

![[Pasted image 20201105235057.png]]

the box is just a transfer function, and it could represent the magnitude, phase and magnitude gain:

![[Pasted image 20201105235132.png]]

![[Pasted image 20201105235501.png]]

### Zeros and Poles
We could factorize the polynomials in the transfer function to identify the frequencies associated with the zeros and the poles

![[Pasted image 20201105235557.png]]

The transfer function consists of:
- The gain $A_{ref}$
- Zero, the root of the numerator and is a value of 's' that causes $H(s) = 0$
- Pole, a root of the denominator, is a value of 's' that causes $H(s) = \infty$
- Simple zero (1 + $\frac{s}{w_{z1}}$) or a simple pole 1/(1 + s/$w_{p1}$)

# Bode Plot

Bode plots are used to plot transfer function in terms of both magnitude and phase response. Transfer function needs to cover a large range of requencies, which is plotted on the x-axis, and in a log scale(non-linear)

The bode magnitude plot, gain is plotted in decibels(DB) as a function of frequency
$$H_{db} = 20log_{10}|H|$$

For bode phase plot, phase is plotted in degree as a function of frequency, and to construct bode plot, each of these factors are plotted separately and added graphically.
