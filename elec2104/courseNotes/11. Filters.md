if there are frequency dependent elements in a circuit.

## bandwidths of band-pass fiter

A reduction of 3 dB in magnitude corresponds to 50% reduction in power, and this has been chosen as a convenient way to identify the bandwidth. Therefore for a low-pass filter, a 200kHz bandwidth indicates that 200 Hkz is the frequency at which half of the signal power is supressed. 

### The -3dB Bandwidth

First, we have the â€“3dB version of bandwidth. If a baseband signal is being described, I would assume that bandwidth indicates the range of frequencies from 0 Hz to the frequency at which the frequency-domain representation of the signal has a magnitude that is 3 dB lower than the maximum magnitude.
