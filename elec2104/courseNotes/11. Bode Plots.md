# Zeros and Poles

When dealing with transfer functions, we factorize the polynomials in the transfer function to identify the frequencies associated with the zeros and poles

$$\frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in})(s)} = H(s) = A_{ref}\frac{(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{z1}})+(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{z2}})+(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{z3}})}{(1+\frac{s}{\omega_{p1}}) + (1+\frac{s}{\omega_{p2}}) + (1+\frac{s}{\omega_{p3}})}$$

It consists:
- low/zero frequency gain A_{ref}
- Zero, values of 's' that causes H(s) = 0
- Pole, values of 's' that causes $H(s) \rightarrow \infty$
- A simple zero or a simple pole

## Bode Plots
Bode plots plot transfer function in terms of both magnitude and phase response. The x-axis plots frequencies on the log scale, and the y axis plots the gain in decibels(DB) as a function of frequency. 

> $$H_{dB} = 20log_{10}|H|$$

For Bode plot, **phase** is plotted in degree as a function of frequency.

## Bode Analysis
A transfer function could be broken into two components:
- Magnitude gain(dB)
- Phase

Magnitude gain could be expressed as 
$$\alpha(\omega) = 20log_{10}|H(s=j\omega)|$$

and the phase is
$$\theta(\omega)=\angle H(s=j\omega)$$

Let $H(s=j\omega)=A\frac{1+\frac{j\omega}{\omega_z}}{1+\frac{j\omega}{\omega_p}}$, we could then obtain the magnitude and phase as:

> Magnitude
> $$20log_{10}|H(j\omega)| = 20log_{10}(A)+20log_{10}|1+\frac{j\omega}{\omega_z}|-20log_{10}|1+\frac{j\omega}{\omega_p}|$$
> phase: $$\angle H(s=j\omega)=\theta_A+tan^{-1}(\frac{\omega}{\omega_z})-tan^{-1}(\frac{\omega}{\omega_p})$$

## Plot Amplitude
The first term $20log|H(j\omega)|$ is a constant, so it is a horizontal line in the graph.

The next term is $20log|1+\frac{j\omega}{\omega_z}|$. We could calculate the modulus of the complex number using $x + iy = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, which gives us $20log\sqrt{1+(\frac{\omega}{\omega_z})^2}$

From this result, we could have that:
if $\omega << \omega_z$, $20log(1) = 0$
if $\omega >> \omega_z$, $\alpha_z(\omega) \approx 20log(\frac{\omega}{\omega_z})$

The last term gives

Combining the three plots, we could obtain:

## Plot Phase
Consider the phase of the transfer function:
$$\angle H (s = j\omega) = \theta(\omega) = \theta_A + tan^{-1}(\frac{\omega}{\omega_z})-tan^{-1}(\frac{\omega}{\omega_p})$$

The term $\theta_A$ is a constant, and if $A > 0, \theta_A = 0^o, A< 0, \theta_A = 180^o$

Consider the second term in the phase function, $tan^{-1}$ has a range of 0 to 90, and $tan^{-1} = 45^o$,
