# Diode Circuit Analysis
For the below simplified loop, there is a voltage source, a resistor and a diode. 

![[Pasted image 298.png]]

We could obtain the below equation with loop analysis:

> $$V = I_DR+V_D$$

Our goal is to find the [quiescent operating point(Q-point)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biasing)[^1] , or the bias point for the diode.

[^1]: amount of direct current that electronic devices need to operate correctly

There are several techniques that could use in order to obtain the Q-point, such as: 
- graphical analysis with load line approach
- mathematical analysis using exponential model
- ideal diode model
- constant-voltage model

### load line analysis
A load-line analysis involves the following steps:
##### step 1
transform the circuit into a thevenin equivalent circuit with a voltage source, a resistor and a diode.
![[Pasted image 299.png]]
##### step 2
Write the load line equation for $V_D$ in terms of $I_D$
$$V_D = V - I_DR$$
##### step 3
Find 2 points to plot the load line.

##### step4
Plot the diode i-v curve with
$$I_D = I_S[exp(\frac{V_D}{V_T}-1)]$$

#### step5
The Q-point is the intersection of the load line and I_V curve

we then need to solve it using Newton's Iterative method that involve the following steps:

# Ideal Diode Model

we could simplify the model further to just a switch, that is, diode has two states: on and off. If it is on, it is a conductor and current could flow through it. Otherwise it results in open circuit and cannot conduct currents.

![[Pasted image 304.png]]

![[Pasted image 305.png]]

Diodes could be placed in series. For the following circuits, determine which one could conduct current.

![[Pasted image 307.png]]

**guess**: only the first circuit could conduct current.


### Ideal diodes in resistor circuits

The ideal diode model assumes that there is zero voltage drop when there is current through, and zero current through the diode when it is off. 

![[Pasted image 308.png]]

As for the above circuit, when $V_in < 0$, the diode opens(open circuit, as a negative voltage is applied), and hence $V_out = V_in$.

When $V_in$ is greater than zero, the diode becomes a short circuit, so $V_out = 0$

![[Pasted image 309.png]]

## Analysis using Ideal Diode Model
we could follow the below steps to conduct a diode analysis:
![[Pasted image 310.png]]

for example:

![[Pasted image 311.png]]

##### problem 1
for the left circuit, the 10v srouce tries to apply a positive current through the diode. We could first assume that the diode is on, then it becomes a short circuit. 
![[Pasted image 312.png]]
we could then calculate the current through:

$$I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{10v}{10k\Omega} = 1mA $$

the current $I_D > 0$ which satisfies the assumption that when there is a positive current, $V_D = 0$ and $I_D > 0$, Hence the q-point is (1mA, 0V)

##### problem 2
since source is forcing a negative current, we assume that the diode is off(which means it acts as an open circuit)

Using $V_D = V - I_DR$, we could have $10 + V_D + 10^4I_D$ 
![[Pasted image 313.png]]

since $I_D = 0$ due to the open circuit, we now have $I_D = 0$, and hence $V_D = -10$, which satisfies that the assumption that the diode is off.

Therefore the Q-point is (0, -10V).

####   problem3-- two diode analysis
![[Pasted image 314.png]]

When there are two diodes, there are four possible combinations of states. First we could assume that both $D_1$ and $D_2$ are on.

![[Pasted image 315.png]]

here, $I_1 = I_{D2} + I_{D1}$,
![[Pasted image 316.png]]

However, the result contradicts the assumption we've made(that is, both diodes are on, but the current through $D_1$ is negative). Therefore we have to change the assumptions.

Let's make $D_2$ on and $D_1$ off. This results in the current flowing from C to F, without any current going to the ground.
![[Pasted image 317.png]]

we could then obtain that $I_{D2} = I_1$
$$15-10000I_1-5000I_{D2}-(-10) = 0$$
$$I1 = \frac{25v}{15000\Omega}=1.67mA$$
$$V_{D1} = 15-10000I_1 = 15-16.7 = -1.67V$$

The voltage at $V_D1$ is negative, which proves that it is off, and the current through $D_2$ is positive, proving that it is on. Both assumptions are correct, and we could make conclusion that the q-point is $D_1$:(0mA, -1.67V) and $D_2$ :(1.67mA, 0V).

# Constant-Voltage Diode Model

This model takes into account the voltage drop across a diode when it is on, which is different from the ideal diode model that assumes there is no voltage across a diode if it is on.

In this model, diode has an "on" voltage denoted as $V_{D,on}$, which is the voltage drop required to "activate" a diode.

if $V_D < V_{D,on}$, then diode operates as an open circuit, and otherwise, it acts as a constant voltage source of $V_{D,on}$.

### Break point
The constant-voltage diode model has a different break point compared to the ideal diode model. A main difference is the break point. 

In the ideal diode model, the break point is at the point where both input and output voltages are zero. From this point, any increase in input voltage will proportionally contribute to increase in output voltage. 

However, in the constant voltage diode model, it is not enough to just provide a positive voltage, the amount needs to be high enough to overcome the voltage drop for the diode to activate it. 
![[Pasted image 319.png]]

### example

![[Pasted image 320.png]]

With the ideal diode model, the current is just
$$I_D = \frac{10V}{10k\Omega}=1mA$$

As for the constant voltage diode model, we take the voltage drop into consideration:

$$I_D = \frac{10-0.6V}{10k\Omega} = 0.94mA$$

and the Q-point for a diode under constant voltage model is therefore (0.94mA, 0.6V)

### voltage divider with diode
below is a [voltage divider](https://www.sparkfun.com/quiz/46). A voltage divider could convert a higher voltage input to a lower one. It does this by dividing the input voltage according to two resistors r1 and r2. There is an equation for voltage dividers:
![[Pasted image 322.png]]

>$$V_{out} = V_{in}\frac{R_2}{R_2+R_1}$$

Now consider the below voltage divider containing a diode.

![[Pasted image 321.png]]

first we let the voltage $V_{in} = -\infty$, we then have
$$V_{out} = V_{D,on}+V_{in}$$ according to the kirchoff's voltage law.

Then we determine the current flowing through $R_1$ 
$I_{R1} = \frac{V_{out}}{R_1} = \frac{V_{D,on}+V_{in}}{R_1}$

As $V_{in}$ decreases, $I_{R1} = I_{R2}$.when $I_{R1} = I_{R2}$, then there is no current flowing through the diode, which means $I_D = 0$.  

$$I_{R2} = \frac{V_{out}-V{in}}{R_2} = \frac{V_{D,on}}{R_2} = -\frac{V_{D,on} - V_in}{R_1}$$

and hence 
$$V_{in} = -V_{D,on}(1+\frac{R_1}{R_2})$$

by re-organising terms, we could obtain:
$$V_{D,on} = -V_{in}(\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2})$$which is the break point after which the slope changes for voltage output and input.

# Piecewise-linear Model

## Zener Diode
the constant-voltage model could be used to analyse zener diodes in **reverse breakdown** as a **piecewise linear model**

The Zener diode has a voltage drop $V_Z$ as well as a resistance $R_Z$.
![[Pasted image 323.png]]

Since a zener diode must operate under reverse breakdown, a negative current must be applied to it.

## Reverse Breakdown Analysis
we could analyse the q-point with load-line analysis:

![[Pasted image 324.png]]

## A Zener Voltage Regulator
we could make a zener diode serve as a regular in breakdown operatiosn where $I_z > 0$ 

The Zener diode keeps the voltage across load resistor $R_L$ constant. 

![[Pasted image 325.png]]

for proper regulation, $I_Z$ must be positive. Otherwise the diode cannot control voltage across the load resistor.

$$I_Z = \frac{V_S}{R}-V_Z(\frac{1}{R}+\frac{1}{R_L})>0$$

that is
>$$R_L > \frac{R}{(\frac{V_S}{V_Z}-1)} = R_{min}$$

where $R_{min}$ indicates the minimum load resistance for the Zener diode to continue to act as a voltage regulator. 

## an example
Find the output voltage and the Zener diode current for the following Zener diode based voltage regulator circuit.
