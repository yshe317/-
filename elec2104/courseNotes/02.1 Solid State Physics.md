# Valency
The electrons in an atom have different energy levels, called **atom orbitals**. The electrons orbits the atoms at different levels, and the electrons at the outershell or outer orbit are called **valence electrons**.

Valence Electrons determine the chemical properties of atoms, since all atoms have a tendency to reach full outershell(8 valence electrons).

# Silicon
Silicon is a special element that is highly relevent to the development of the IT industry(consider "Silicon Valley"). It is refined from sands and has 4 valence electrons. 

Silicon could form crystals in a way that each Silicon atom forms covalent bonds with 4 adjacent silicon atoms. These bonds may break under high temperature, freeing electrons, and allowing them to carry charges. When an electron is freed, a hole is left behind as the bond is broken. Since an electron is negatively charged, the hole is positively charged(overall charge shall not change).

# Hole and Electron
![[Pasted image 129.png]]

An electron with charge (q = -1.602 * $10^{-19} C$)  from adjacent bonds may move to the hole and fill the vacancy, creating a new hole at another position.

The moving of vacency may behave as a charge with +q .(since we could interpret the moving of negatively charged electron as a negative charge, changing position of positively charged holes could also be interpreted as a positive charge.)

## Hole Density
### Terminologies
The number of electrons per unit volume in the conduction band or the number of holes per unit volume in the valence band is called `intrinsic carrier concentration`. 

The number of electrons per unit volume in the conduction band is called `electron-carrier concentration`

The number of holes per unit volume in the valence band is called as `ole-carrier concentration`

### Replationships among 3 concentrations
In an intrinsic semiconductor, the number of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the number of electrons in the valence band, and hence, the `electron-carrier concentration` is equal to  the `hole-carrier concentration`. 

Hole density is represented by symbol p($holes/cm^{3}$). First notice that $n = p$ as every electron that is freed results in a new hole produced. And as discussed in the last paragraph, electron-carrier concentration is equal to the hole-carrier concentration, and we may use a value `intrinsic carrier concentration` to define this concentration at thermal equilibrium, which makes $n = p = n_i$, and hence ==$np = n_i^{2}$==

# Bandgap Energy
There are two bands that indicate the number of electrons that contain certain amount of energy. One is called conduction band, electrons within this band could conduct currents as they are "activitaed" by enough energy. Another Band is called valence band where electrons aren't that active and needs enough energy to "promote" to the conduction band. 


## Metal and Insulator
The energy needed to promote an electron from valence band to conduction band is known as the ==bandgap energy==. The bandgap energy determines if a material is ideal for conducting currents or isulating currents.

Metals normally have partially filled conduction band(this is why metals could easily conduct currents) and filld valence band, and have a smaller Bandgap energy compared to insulators. 

On the other hand, insulators have a large band gap energy and empty conduction band, so it needs a tremendous amount of electric field applied to them in order for them to conduct currents(which is not possible in most cases, so they can insulate currents).

## Semiconductors
As for semiconductors, they have empty conduction band as well, which means they normally can not conduct electricity unless external energy excites the electrons and promotes them to the conduction band. Since the bandgap is relatively small for semiconductors, it is relatively easy to make them conductable compared to insulators.

## Behavior of Electrons
At absolute zero, all electrons are held in covalent bonds and there are no free electrons(all in valence band), and as temperature gradually increases, certain bonds are broken, meaning some electrons have entered conduction band and could hence conduct currents(also leaving positively charged holes behind).

## Calculate Intrinsic Carrier Density
The intrinsic carrier density ($n_i(cm^{-3}$)) depends on =material properties and temperature.

![[Pasted image 133.png]]

The unit eV(electron volt) represents the energy necessary to move one electron across potential difference of 1V, 

$-1 eV = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}J$.

**room temperature** is: 300K

**$E_G$** = 1.42

# Extrinsic Semiconductor
An extrinsic semiconductor involves adding impurities to an intrinsic semiconductor. Depending on the valency of the impurity, we could classify it as either an acceptor or a donor. 

The introduction of impurities into semicondutor is also called Doping, and extrinsic semiconductor could also be called "doped semiconductor".
## Donor Impurities
A donor impurity normally has valency 5(from column V), which means after making 4 covalent bonds with 4 Silicon atoms, it still has one extra spare electrons. The free electron could serve as a charge carrier.

## Acceptor impurities
Acceptor impurities are atoms that have insufficient number(3 valence electrons) of electrons to form incomplete covalent bonds, and hence holes are created(as a result of incomplete bonds). Boron is an example of an acceptor impurity. 

The acceptor atom becomes ionized by accepting an electron and has a net immobiled fixed charge of -q in the crystal lattice.

## Extrinsic Carrier Density
In intrinsic semiconductor, $p \times n = n_i{2}$, and it is the **same** for extrinsic semicondutor. 

## N-type and T-type materials
When a semiconductor contains acceptor or donor impurities, n and p are no longer equal. If $n > q$, we call it a N-type material, and otherwise we call it a T-type material. The carrier with greater population is referred to as the **majority carrier**, and the carrier with smaller population is **minor carrier**.

According to the [charge neutrality](http://www.ece.utep.edu/courses/ee3329/ee3329/Studyguide/ToC/Fundamentals/Carriers/neutrality.html), $q(N_D + p - N_A - n ) = 0$, and this makes $N_D + p - N_A - n = 0$, also $p = \frac{n_i^{2}}{n}$, by substituting the value of p into the former equation, we could obtain:

![[Pasted image 136.png]]

Notice that in practical situations,  $N_D - N_A >> 2n_i$ for $N_D > N_A$ and vice versa, and hence we could obtain the approximation for n for n-type and p-type materials.
