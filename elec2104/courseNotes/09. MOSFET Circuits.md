# MOSFET
## Structure and Symbol for NMOS
An NMOS transistor is fabricated as two n-wells in a p-type subtrate. During inversion, a layer of electrons concentrates under the insulation layer, forming a channel that connects the drain and source. Normally, we say carriers go from source to drain, but in fact, since MOSFET is symmetrical, they could go either way. 

The NMOS symbol is on the right and there is an arrow pointing in the direction of current flow (pointing towards the source).

## PMOS
A PMOS has two **p-wells** with a** n-type subtrate**, during inversion, a layer of** holes** collects under the oxide and connects the two p-wells. The arror in the circuit symbol also points in the direction of current flow, but since it's a PMOS, the current flows from source to drain.

## Channel-Length Modulation
Drain current is actually not constant in the saturation region, instead, it increases slightly as drain-source voltage increase. Ideally when applying $V_{DS}$ to the drain, the length of the channel should not change, however, in reality it decreases slightly as $V_{DS}$ increases as $\Delta L$ increrases. This also affects the drain current as it is dependent on the channel length.

Recall from [[08.2 MOSFET#8 2 5 2 Saturation Region | saturation region ]] that 
$$I_D = \frac{1}{2}\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L_1}(V_{GS}-V_{TN})^2$$

To account for the channel length modulation, we add additional term with $\lambda$, which is a parameter for channel-length modulation. 

> $$I_D = \frac{1}{2}\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L_1}(V_{GS}-V_{TN})^2(1 + \lambda V_{DS})$$

If $\lambda$ is not given as 0, then we need to use the above equation to show that we know how $V_{DS}$ could influence $I_D$

Unlike the [[06 Bipolar Junction Transistors#6 6 Early Effect | Early Voltage]] in BJT, the channel-length modulation factor can be controlled by the circuit designer. This is because we could not control base width in a BJT, but we could control gate length of a MOSFET. For long L,  the channel-length modulation effect is less than that of short L.

# Body Effect
So far we've assumed that the source and substrate terminals are tied to ground. However, if the substate is at a difference voltage from the source, the threshold voltage can change:
> $$V_{Th} = V_{Th0} + \gamma(\sqrt[]{V_{SB} + 2\psi_B} - \sqrt[]{2\psi B})$$

$V_{Th0}$ is the threshold voltage for $V_{SB}$ = 0. where $V_{SB}$ is the voltage difference between the source and the bulk(the substrate)
$2\psi_B$ is the surface potential (V)
$\gamma$ is the body effect parameter where $$\gamma = \frac{\sqrt[] {qN_A2\varepsilon_s}}{C_{ox}}(\sqrt[]{V})$$

However, for most circuits in this course, the substrate will be connected to the same potential as the source, then the body effect is gone.

# Region of Operation

Circuit analysis is much easier than with BJTs, because current can only go in one direction. It's either **triode** or **saturation**, just substitute numbers into equations to verify. 

For example:

# MOSFET Large Signal Model
A MOSFET can be represented using different circuit models depending on its region of operation. When it is operating in the triode region, $V_{DS}$ is much smaller than ($V_{GS]} - V_{TH}$), the I-V curve is linear. The MOSFET is a resistor independent of $V_{DS}$
 

![[Pasted image 20201026230053.png]]

The resistance $$R_{on} = \frac{V_{DS}}{I_{DS}}$$

When operating in the triode region, and $V_{DS}$ approaches (V_{GS} - V_{TH}), the I-V curve is non-linear, the MOSFET is a voltage-controlled current source. 

![[Pasted image 20201026230347.png]]

When operating in saturation, $V_{GS} > V_{TH}$, and $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. Ideally the drain current would only dependent on $V_{GS}$, but we also need to take channel-length modulation into account, so it must be a voltage controlled current source as well

![[Pasted image 20201026230531.png]]


# Linear triode Circuit Model
When operating in the triode region, but $V_{DS}$ is much smaller than (V_{GS} - V_{Th]}), the I-V curve is linear, which means we could model it as a resistor.

 This triode operation mode has application in cell phones to avoid saturation near base stations. The voltage could actually be controlled by modifying the gate source voltage(which influences $R_M$, and hence the voltage $V_{out}$)

 Below is an example of MOSFET as a voltage-controlled resistor:
![[Pasted image 20201026232118.png]]

Think about how we could compute $V_o$ in terms of $V_s$, according to the voltage division, $\frac{V_o}{V_S} = \frac{R_{on}}{R_{on} + R}$. Let $R_{on} = \frac{1}{\alpha}$ where $\alpha = \mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS}-V_{TH})$

Then we could have $\frac{R_{on}}{R_{on} + R} = \frac{\frac{1}{\alpha}}{\frac{1}{\alpha} + R} = \frac{1}{1 + R\alpha} = \frac{1}{1 + R\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS}-V_{TH})}$

If we give some numerical values to this question, we could have:
![[Pasted image 20201026232710.png]]

Hence, $V_S \leq 0.750V$ is a pre-condition for the MOSFET to act as a voltage-controlled resistor.

## Non-linear Triode Circuit Model
When $V_{DS}$ approaches ($V_{GS} - V_{TH}$), we could model it as a voltage controleld current source. 

![[Pasted image 20201026233023.png]]

## Saturation Circuit Model
The MOSFET in saturation is a voltage-controlled current source\
![[Pasted image 20201026233148.png]]

## Summary for Regiosn of Operations
- The cut-off is $V_{GS} = 0$
- The saturation is when $V_{GS} > V_{TH}$ and $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$
- Triode: $V_{GS} > V_{TH}$ and $V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{TH}$

For PMOS, all values are negative, such that

- The cut-off is $V_{GS} = 0$
- The saturation is when $V_{GS} < V_{TH}$ and $V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{TH}$
- Triode: $V_{GS} < V_{TH}$ and $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$

However, the equation is the same:
> $$I_{D, sat} = \frac{1}{2}\mu_pC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS}-V_{TH})^2(1 + \lambda V_{DS})$$
> $$I_{D, tri} = \frac{1}{2}\mu_pC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}[2(V_{GS}-V_{TH})V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2)]$$


According to the value of $V_{DS}$, the MOSFET can be represented with different large-signal models

# MOSFET Biasing
Changes in $V_{GS}$ result in a quadratic response in the drain current. We could also monitor the large voltage swing across $V_{DS}$ if we connect a resistor in series with the MOSFET. This is how MOSFET could act as an amplifier(as it amplifies the small changes in $V_{GS}$ to larger change in the drain current), just like a BJT. 
![[Pasted image 20201027105056.png]]

Ideally, we want to make $I_D$ less dependent on the parameters such as $\beta$ or $V_{DS}$. 

## MOSFET transconductance
> MOSFET Transconductance measures how much the drain current changes when the gate voltage changes. 

Recall that $I_D = \frac{1}{2}\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L_1}(V_{GS}-V_{TN})^2(1 + \lambda V_{DS})$,(and due to the second order effect, we could ignore the term for body effect)*, and the transconductance $g_m$ is just how changes in $V_{GS}$ influences changes in $I_D$, then we have

$g_m = \frac{\delta I_D}{\delta V_{GS}} = \beta_n(V_{GS} - V_{Th}) = \frac{2I_D}{V_{GS} - V_{Th}}$

We could then obtain 3 expressions:
> $$g_m = \mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{Th})$$
> $$g_m = \sqrt[]{2\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}I_D}$$
> $$g_m = \frac{2I_D}{V_{GS} - V_{Th}}$$

In general, we use the second equation, which is
> $$g_m = \sqrt[]{2\beta I_D}$$

The MOSFET transconductance increases as the square-root of drain current increases and independent of transistor geometry $\frac{W}{L}$. By contrast, BJT transconductance increases proportionally with collector current. This means MOSFET is not a strong amplifier compared to BJT, as it normally has lower transconductance(square root of the drain current).

## MOSFET Small Signal Model
Small signal model considers small changes around a bias point, and it could be used for calculations. In order to represent the channel-length modulation, an output resistance is inserted into the model. 
(we assume that $\lambda$ is very very small, so the term ($1+\lambda V_{DS}$) could be ignored
$$r_o = (\frac{\delta I_D}{\delta V_{DS}})^{-1} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS} - V_{Th})^2\lambda} \approx \frac{1}{\lambda I_D}$$

![[Pasted image 20201027111458.png]]

The small signal model of PMOS device is identical to that of NMOS transistor. Even though we've inverted it, the current is also reverted. 

![[Pasted image 20201027112513.png]]

## MOSFET Biasing
Biasing sets the DC operating point, and typically we pul the MOSFET into saturation. The signal consists of small changes in the input voltage or current in the case of BJTs. 

A voltage divider could be used to bias the game, for example, let's find the Q-point of the MOSFET($I_D$, $V_{DS}$):

![[Pasted image 20201027112935.png]]

We could obtain the gate voltage, and convert the given circuit to its Thevenin equivalent. 


### Biasing Example

---
![[Pasted image 20201027113309.png]]

---

Since $I_G = 0$, there is no current flowing through the gate, and hence $V_{EQ} = V_{GS}$ 

---
Find the Q-point of the MOSFET $(I_D, V_{DS})$
![[Pasted image 20201027114331.png]]

First we need to check $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{TH}$. It is provided that $I_D = 50.0\mu A$, $V_{DS} = 5.00V$ and $V_{GS} = 3V$. 

$I_D = \frac{\beta_N}{2}(V_{GS} - V_{Th})^2$, However, the Q-point is very sensitive to change and hence is not widely used. 


![[Pasted image 20201027114616.png]]


The load line analysis helps us easily visualise the region of operation.

### Biasing with Channel Length Modulation
When $\lambda$ could not be ignored, for example:


![[Pasted image 20201027115004.png]]

### Four-Ressitor Biasing
Since we don't want the MOSFET operation to be dependent on $\beta$ values, so we could add a source resistor to reduce dependence and stablise MOSFET Q-point.


![[Pasted image 20201027115524.png]]

Since $V_X$, $R_S$ are both fixed, if $I_D$ increases, $V_{GS}$ must decrease to maintain $V_X$, which in turn reduces $I_D$. Hence, $I_D$ is restored back to its original value, compensating the influence on $I_D$. This means the drain current is stablised. 

Example:

![[Pasted image 20201027120734.png]]

![[Pasted image 20201027120842.png]]

![[Pasted image 20201027121015.png]]

### Negative Feedback
 ![[Pasted image 20201027120234.png]] 
 
 The third equation is obtained by substituting the formula for $I_D$ to the second equation, and then apply the quadratic formula, taking the positive root. 
 
 
 ## Self-Bias
 
![[Pasted image 20201027121209.png]]

Since the gate could be considered as an open terminal that does not conduct current, $R_G$ does not divide the voltage, hence, $V_G = V_D$, and $V_{GS} = V_{DS}$. Therefore, $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{Th}$. Therefore, this MOSFET is** always in the saturation mode.**

Below is an example of solving a self-biasing MOSFET.
