# 7.1 Reverse BJT
We could reverse a BJT by fliping it, which interchanges the position of the emitter terminal and the collector terminal. Since a BJT is not symmetrical,that is, the emitter side is more heavily doped than the collector side, the characteristics of BJT alters due to the reverse bias. 

For example, the reverse common-emitter gain is:
> $$0 \leq \beta_R \leq 10$$

which is much smaller than the gain in the forward active region, that is, 
$50 \leq \beta_r \leq 500$.  $\alpha_R < 0.95$ and is also smaller than the forward active one. It could still be used as an amplifier, but is not a good one since the gain is very small. 

The reverse current is:
> $$i_R = -i_E = I_S[exp(\frac{V_BC}{V_T})-1]$$


# 7.2 Other regions of Operation
## 7.2.1 Cut-Off region:
The cutoff region occurs when both the base-collector and base-emitter are reverse biased. It has 
$$V_C > V_B < V_E $$
In a cut-off region of operation, no carriers could flow from the emitter to collector, "turning off" the BJT.

## 7.2.2 Saturation Region:
This occurs when both the base-emitter and base-collector junctions are forward biased. The BJT is considered as "fully turned on". The amount of carriers that can go from emitter to collector is fixed, and hence changing the base current will no longer increase the collector current. 

This region normally occurs when the base current is so large that the collector current can no longer increase proportionally. 

## 7.2.3 Summary of regions of Operation
Cut-off region and saturation region could only be used as switches that turn the BJT on and off, even though they are not good switches(MOSFET is a better option). These two regions are not used for BJT and the equations for BJT only apply to the forward active region.

## 7.2.4 Operation Regions
The cut-off region is when $V_{BE} < V_{cut-in}$, that the voltage is smaller than the turn on voltage of a diode (0.7V), and there is no current.

When the voltage equals to the cut-in voltage, the BJT is "turned on" and could allow current flowing through it. This is the active region of the BJT.

Under active region, if the base current gets too huge that exceeds the maximum range of the collector current, it is under the saturation region and the current could no longer increase according to change in $I_B$

==Any point in the below diagram is a Q-point for the BJT since it is composed of $I_c$ and $V_{CE}$. Notice that each curve in the graph corresponds to a different gain ( $\beta$ ) value.==

# 7.3 Biasing a BJT
The whole point of biasing is to establish known Q point and operating region of the transistor. When the BJT is under forward active region(forward bias, and the voltage is larger than the turn on voltage), the small-signal operation occurs at the Q point, which is small changes around the bias point. The bias point is a DC value and

## 7.3.1 Signal Analysis
DC analysis involves performing **large-signal analysis** and determines which region of operation and small-signal parameters are used. We could also calculate all the small signal parameters using it such as $g_m, \beta, r_\pi$. 

After that, we study the circuit response to small signals. We use **small signal analysis** to compute how much gain we could have without considering the DC voltage (instead we use small $V_{in}$).

![[Pasted image 20201017162641.png]]

## 7.3.2 Notations
we use lowercase $v_{in}$ to represent small signal  input voltage, and DC supplies are shown as solid power supplies, which could be represented by a horizontal bar. 

![[Pasted image 20201017162900.png]]

## 7.3.3 Application of Small-signal model
We could only use the small-signal model when the sginal does not perturb the system too much that the bias point changes. This ensures that the small signal parametrs are not varying much, which means we could consider them as constants. (==10% variation in the collector current==)


## 7.4 Four concepts of biasing a BJT
### 7.4.1 Fixed-Bias
The base is tied to $V_{cc}$ through a relatively large resistor. Assuming a constant value for $V_{BE}$, then we could have

$I_B = \frac{V_{CC} - V{BE}}{R_B}$, which means 
$I_C = \beta I_B$, and then we could get the collector emitter voltage 
$V_{CE} = V_{CC} - I_CR_C$

Hence $V_{CE}$ determines if the device is in active mode or not depending on its value compared to $V_{BE}$. 

![[Pasted image 20201017164057.png]]

When analysing for a fixed-bias BJT, we could consider the two loops: base -> emitter loop and the collector -emitter loop using KVL. 

##### load-line analysis

We could conduct the load-line anlaysis with the following equation obtained using KVL:\
>$$V_{CE} = V_{CC} - I_CR_C$$

 If we plot this line against the I-V characteristics of a BJT, we could obtain the saturation and cut-off region of BJT. 

As shown in the following graph:
![[Pasted image 20201017175335.png]]

If we set $I_C = 0$, we could obtain the cut-off voltage which is $V_{CC}$, and if we change $I_C$ to 0, we could have $V_{CEcut-off} = V_{CC}$. The intersection between the load line and the curve is the Q point(operation point) for a specific base current. The base current is determined by the resistance $R_B$

Therefore, we could obtain a chain of dependency when doing load-line analysis:

$$R_B \rightarrow I_B \rightarrow Q-point$$

Consider if we change $V_{CC}$, the load line shifts accordingly, and so does the Q-point.
![[Pasted image 20201017180355.png]]

##### improve the fixed-bias
There could be changes in $\beta$ due to thermal stability issues where different transistors used, and since $I_B$ is fixed, $I_C$ is dependent on $\beta$, which changes and hence the Q-point varies. This means the fixed-bias has poor stability due to the dependency between $I_C$ and $\beta$.

In order to improve the fixed biasing, we could extend the circuit at base side with a resistor and connect it to the ground, making a a resistor divider which sets $V_{BE}$. Hence $I_C$ is independent of $\beta$ since the base current is very small. (by modifying the ratio of $R_1$ and $R_2$)
![[Pasted image 20201018111412.png]]

Below is how to obtain $I_C$ when the base current $I_B$ is negligible 
$$V_X = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}V_{CC}$$
$$I_C = I_S exp(\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}\frac{V_{CC}}{V_{T}})$$

##### $I_B$ not negligible
However, if $I_B$ is not negligible, we need to consider the current flowing through $R_1$. To do this, we could compute the Thevenin equivalent of the base side circuit. 

![[Pasted image 20201018112555.png]]

$V_{thev} = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{CC}$ and $R_{thev} = (\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2})^-1$. After simplifying the original circuit, we could then compute the voltage 

![[Pasted image 20201018112817.png]]


$V_X = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}V_{CC} - I_BR_{thev}$

and hence 
> $$I_C = I_Sexp(\frac{v_{thev} - I_BR_{thev}}{V_T})$$

### 7.4.2 four resistor bias network

This means an exponential dependence of $I_C$ on voltage generated by resistive divider. This indicates that $I_C$ changes a lot according to changes in $I_B$.  We don't want $I_C$ to be dependent on the base resistor, so adding a resistor $R_E$ could force $V_{thev} - V_{BE} >> I_BR_{Thev}$

This is because:
$V_{thev}  =  I_BR_{Thev} +  V_{BE}  + I_ER_E$ and $I_E = (\beta_F + 1) I_B$, which makes

$$I_B = \frac{V_{thev}-V_{BE}}{R_{thev}+(\beta_F+1)R_E}$$
If we increase $R_E$, the $I_B$ decreases accordingly, and we could make $I_B$ negligible. 


$$I_E = \frac{V_{thev} - V_{BE} - I_BR_{Thev}}{R_E} \approx \frac{V_{thev} - V_{BE}}{R_E}$$
and we could assume
$$I_C \approx I_E$$

### 7.4.3 Disgn of four-resistor network
When designing for a four-resistor network, we need to ensure the transistor is in forward-active mode by setting $V_{BE}$, and deisgn $I_C$ to give the small signal parameters $g_m, r_\pi$, etc.  Notice that the below range are not fixed, but they are recommendation for a good starting point. 

Then choose thevenin equivalent base voltage in:
$$\frac{V_{CC}}{4} \leq V_{Thev} \leq \frac{V_{CC}}{2}$$
It needs to be large enough that varying $V_B$ does not influence $I_E$ too much since $I_C \approx I_E = \frac{V_{thev}-V_{BE}}{R_E}$. 

Also, we want $I_B$ small enough that it is much smaller than $I_{R2}$ so that $I_{R1} \approx I_{R2}$. Therefore we could set $R_1$so that  $I_1 = 10I_B$.
$$R_1 = \frac{V_{CC}-V_{thev}}{10I_B}$$

and select $R_2$  to make $I_2 = 9I_B$
$$R_2 = \frac{V_{thev}}{9I_B}$$

$R_E$ is determined by $V_{thev}$ and desired $I_C$
$$R_E \approx \frac{V_{thev} - V_{BE}}{I_C}$$

$R_C$ is determined by desired $V_{CE}$
$$R_C \approx \frac{V_{CC}-V_{CE}}{I_C} - R_E$$


### 7.4.4.-RESISTOR BIAS   
We can "self-bias" a transistor to **force** it into forward active operation. 
![[Pasted image 20201020164303.png]]

$V_Y = V_{CC} - I_CR_C$ and $V_Y = I_BR_B + V_{BE} = \frac{R_BI_C}{\beta} + V_{BE}$.

This gives us ==two design guidelines ==$R_C >> \frac{R_B}{\beta}$, this means the collector current is insensitive to changes in beta. (for $I_C$)

The second provides insensitivity to variation in the base-emittor voltage. (for $I_C$). Also, in this circuit, we could assume that $I_B << I_C$. However, when designing for biasing, we should not ignore $I_B$.
