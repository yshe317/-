# Mobility
Charged particles move in reponse to an applied electric field(called drift)
- Positive charges drift in the same direction as electric field
- Negative charges drift in the opposite direction as electric field

The field current velocity, which measures the speed of the charged particles moving across a material. The drift velocity V is proportional to the electric field E, that is $v \propto E$. We could define a constant of propertionality which is called the mobility $\mu$.

> $V_n = -\mu_nE$ and  $V_p = \mu_pE$ 

(as electrons are negatively charged and flows at the opposite direction)

# Drift Current
The **drift  current**is the movement of charged particles in response to the electric field. We could define the density of drift current as J, and its relationship with charge density and velocity of charge.

## Resistivity of Intrinsic Silicon
$j_n^{drift} = Q_nv_n=(-qn)(-\mu_nE)=qn\mu_nE \  (A/cm^{2})$
$j_p^{drift} = Q_pv_p=(+qp)(+\mu_pE)=qp\mu_pE \ (A/cm^{2})$

Hence the total current density is

>$j_T^{drift} = q(n\mu_n+p\mu_p)E$
>$= \sigma E$
>where $\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity ($\Omega \cdot cm$)

Here $\sigma$ is the riciprocol of the resistivity $\rho$.
> $$\rho = \frac{1}{\sigma}$$

## Mobility and resistivity in doped semiconductors
Impurities could reduce mobility of the carriers as it disrupts the layout of atoms in a lattice due to different atom sizes. Also, the ionized (positively charged $B^+$ or negatively charged $P^-$) creates localised charges, which disrupts the flow of electrons.

However, doped semiconductors have increased density of majority carriers, which reduces the resistivity and hence increases mobility overall in spite of the negative effects on mobility.

## Velocity Saturation
The velocities of carriers cannot increase infinitely, when the electric field increases to a certain point, the carrier drift velocity will stop increasing, and this is called `velocity Saturation`

For holes and electrons in silicon, the saturated carrier velocity is $v_{sat} \approx 10^{7} cm/s$

# Diffusion Current
Similar to other substances, the free carriers tend to move from high concentration to low concentration, and this is the second current flow mechanism other than the Drift current. This tendency to move to lower concentration is also called 'diffuse', and the current formed due to flow of carriers due to concentration is the diffusion current

If there is a gradient of electron and hole density(let if be positive), then the gradient is positive in +x direction. However, since holes and electrons want to move to places with lower concentration, they will move in -x direction, leading to the following equations.

The below image shows the direction of electron and hole currents. Electron current flows in the opposite direction to hole current and carrier diffusion.

## Einstein's Relationship

The **Einstein's relationship** gives the relationship between diffusitivity and mobility.

The quantity is called the thermal voltage $V_t$
> $\frac{D_n}{\mu_n} = \frac{kT}{q} = \frac{D_p}{\mu_p}$

Note that $D_n$ and $D_p$ are proportionality constants or diffusivity of the semiconductor.

With Einstein's relationship, the total current could be re-written as the sum of the below two equations:
