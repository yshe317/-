# Tips
1. for any equation relating to the charge q of an electron, it is a constant with value $$1.602 \times 10^{-19}$$

2. There are two variants of the equation for the drift current: using current velocity or using mobility
$$q_n^{drift} = qn\mu_nE$$ 
or
$$q_n^{drift} = qnV_n$$

3. We could use Einstein's relationship to obtain the mobility or diffusivity

$$\frac{D_n}{\mu_n} = \frac{kT}{q} = \frac{D_p}{\mu_p}$$
